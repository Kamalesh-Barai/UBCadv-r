We are *very* confused about the "unique names" vs "multiple names can point to the same object".  

```{r}
e <- new.env()
e$a <- FALSE
e$b <- "a"
e$c <- 2.3
e$d <- 1:3

e$a <- e$d

address(e$a)
address(e$d)

e$a[3] <- 3

address(e$a)
address(e$d)

e$a; e$d

```

Seems like you actually *can* have two names for the same object, until one changes.


one interesting use of environments is employed in [this gist](https://gist.github.com/aammd/2d76c4657ab88901c0ed) written by [Rich Fitzjohn](http://nicercode.github.io/about/), formerly of UBC.  In it Rich emulates a Lisp-style "linked list" using Reference Semantics (whatever those are).
