## Exercises 1

1.  Fix each of the following common data frame subsetting errors:

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    #mtcars[mtcars$cyl = 4, ]
    mtcars[mtcars$cyl == 4, ]
    #mtcars[-1:4, ]
    mtcars[-(1:4), ]
   # mtcars[mtcars$cyl <= 5]
    mtcars[mtcars$cyl <= 5,]
#     mtcars[mtcars$cyl == 4 | 6, ]
    mtcars[mtcars$cyl == 4 |mtcars$cyl ==  6, ]
    ```

1.  Why does `x <- 1:5; x[NA]` yield five missing values? Hint: why is 
    it different from `x[NA_real_]`?
    
** Because `NA` is a logical vector, and therefore is recycled to the length of `x` (i.e. 5)
```{r}
x <- 1:5; x[NA] ; x[NA_real_]
```
