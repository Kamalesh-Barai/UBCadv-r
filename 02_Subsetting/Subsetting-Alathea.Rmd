### Quiz

1. *What does subsetting a vector with: positive integers, negative integers, logical vector, character vector?*

**I guess this means what happens when you subset a vector with one of the above.  A positive integer will select the item at that index and a negative integer will remove the item at that index.  I don't know about the vectors.**

1. *Whatâ€™s the difference between `[`, `[[` and `$` when applied to a list?*

**Subsetting with `[` will select a list at that location but `[[` selects the item within that list.  `$` works for a named list.**

1. *When should you use `drop = FALSE`?*

**No one knows!**

1. *If x is a matrix, what does `x[] <- 0` do? How is it different to `x <- 0`?*

**Don't know.**

1. *How can you use a named vector to relabel categorical variables?*

**Maybe `names(data_frame) <- names(vector)` or something like that.**
